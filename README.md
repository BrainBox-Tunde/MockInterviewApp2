# JS Mock Interview (Starter Code)

Use this code as a basis for your mock interview. As always, read through the code you have before starting to write any new code. And remember, **there are no criteria that require you to alter the HTML or CSS**. 

**Your job is to write the JavaScript code that will bring this mini-website to life!**
